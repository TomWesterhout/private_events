This project is part of the Advanced Forms and Active Record chapter of the Ruby on Rails section from The Odin Project.

The task at hand was to setup a Ruby on Rails webapplication containing features similair to the well known event organisation platform Eventbrite.

Users are able to sign up and log in. After the registration process they're able to create and manage events and sign up for events organised by others.
